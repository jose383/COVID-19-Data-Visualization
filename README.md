## Description

In this project we analyzed COVID-19 data through data visualizations and developed a web application using Javascript (D3.js), HTML, and CSS.

## Data Source

This project analyises a three datasets provided by [Vodafone Group Plc](https://www.vodafone.com/); the first dataset contained data collected from the United States; it has 716,376 entries and shows the total number of confirmed cases of each county from January 22nd, 2020 to September 5th, 2020; the second dataset contained data collected from around the world; it has 93,059 entries and shows the total number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases of each country from January 22nd, 2020 to August 22nd, 2020; and finally the third dataset contained data collected from China; it has 14,127 entries and shows the data of patients that got sick from COVID-19. This data set provides us with useful information about the patients such as their Admission Date, Confirmation Date, Province, Sex, Age, Symptoms, Date of Symptoms, Travel history, Travel date, and Patient Outcome.

These datasets provided us with just enough information to create a well-structured initial analysis of this pandemic. With these datasets were able to visualize how the virus spread from China, and which countries and provinces/states were the most affected early in this pandemic.
