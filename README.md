# COVID-19 Data

COVID-19 Data Visualization using D3 Library

## Getting Started

For D3 to work:

If using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the Live Server Package and use it to run the ```index.html``` file

If using [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), run the ```index.html``` file from the browser icons (Chrome, Firefox, etc) inside Webstorm. This will automatically create a server for you, no need of installing anything else.

For Node.js no need of anything else since it already works as a server. But for now I recommend not using the JavaScript with Node so you don't have to spend more time debbuging your code.

If using another text editor without server features. One simple way to create a server is to use Python

Simpy run this command where the ```index.html``` file is located:

- For Python 2 - ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```

- For Python 3 - ```python -m http.server 8000```

Then open a web browser at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
